# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event.

## Structure

Each day's puzzle will have its own directory, named `dayXX` where `XX` is the day number. Inside each directory, you'll find at least two files:

- `input.txt`: The puzzle input.
- `solution.py`: The Python script to solve the puzzle.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the day's directory and run the solution script with Python or if C++, compile and run:

```bash
cd day01
python solution.py

g++ solution.cpp 
./a.out
